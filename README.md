**Convert Auxilium NAND dumps to readable, executable programs.**

**Created by smea ([@fruitypaw](https://github.com/fruitypaw)).**

Tired of just using NAND dumps for boring debugging purposes?

Using BlueBoot, you can convert NAND dumps into actual readable game files!

You can export your NAND to either an executable format or a CFW format (for use in [boot9strap](https://github.com/enfier/boot9strap)).

## FAQ

### Do I need BlueBoot to run NAND dumps?
Yes.

### What program(s) does this work best with?
First, you need [Auxilium](https://github.com/enfier/Auxilium) to even run any of this.

Second, you need [boot9strap](https://github.com/enfier/boot9strap) to run CFW (for either BlueBoot or arm9loaderhax.)

Third, you need [arm9loaderhax](https://github.com/enfier/arm9loaderhax) to dump your NAND.

Lastly, you obviously need BlueBoot itself to convert your NAND.

### What is a NAND dump used for?
Normally, a NAND dump is a .NAND file that takes an entire copy of your Auxilium client. Until recently, it was only used for review and debugging purposes.

### What does BlueBoot do?
BlueBoot lets anyone convert their .NAND to a readable, .bat OR .txt file (for CFW) for easier debugging and sandbox activity.

### Will this project remain free?
Yes.

### Do you accept donations / can I contribute?
No.

### What OS' does this run on?
Windows only.
